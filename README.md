# PointsBot
Ethereum ERC20 Token Bot - Plugins for Slack, Riot, WhatsApp and more

# Purpose
The purpose of PointsBot is to 
- facilitate the distribution of points by circle members
- collate a summary points awarded in a given time period
- calculate the amount of ETH rewarded to 

# Background
There are four circles of authority within the Giveth Community.
- Governance
- Communication
- Product Development
- Social Coding

Members of these circles distribute points to individuals over time, over various channels:
- Slack 
- Riot
- Github (?)
- Face to face

Each Circle has it's own type of points

- GOV Points
- COMMS Points
- DEV Points
- SOCIAL (coding) Points

Ultimately points equate to ETH, that is awarded to the point "holders" at the end of a given time period (e.g. monthly).

Each member has a their own "weight", that gives the points they award more overall value. This way members can distribute any number of point in a given time period, but they will never have any "left over". They may, hovever, have received points from other circle members. 

Points are only distributed by circle members, and are not traded. When a circle member recieves points, they are accounted for seperately from any points they distribute.
